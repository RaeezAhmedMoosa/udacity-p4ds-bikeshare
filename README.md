## Project Information
This is a **Python**-based project, completed in terms of the requirements of
**Udacity's** _Programming for Data Science with Python_ nanodegree program.
This repo contains all the Python code created for this specific project and all
the other necessary files relating to the project.

For this BikeShare project, a user will be able to view and investigate data
focused on the bike sharing systems which have implemented in the following
US cities:

- Chicago
- New York City
- Washington DC

As a developer, you are tasked with creating a **Python** script which will
import the bike sharing data and calculate various types of descriptive statistics
as well as other information. This script must be interactive, in that it will
allow a user to choose a city, choose a filter for the data and allow the user
to view the raw data.

## Files Used
BikeShare uses the following files:

- bikeshare.py
- .csv files for each city
